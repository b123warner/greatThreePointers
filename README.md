# Visualizing the greatest shooters in NBA history

My goal for this project was to determine the greatest 3 point shooter in NBA history through a series of vizualisations. Upon my findings, I am of the opinion that Steph Curry is the best. I scraped career 3 point data from players who made up the top 25 career 3 pointers made list. 

## To run this project:

All one must do is ensure the the *3pointData.csv* is in the same file path as the python script. Then running the script should open up an html page that has 3 tabs. 
1. Shows career games played (x) vs career 3 pointers made (y)
2. Shows the attempted 3s per game (x) vs the made 3s per game(y)
3. Shows a bar plot displaying career 3 point % for all of the players examined.
